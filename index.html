                <p>My name is Billy Joe Ray Birght. I am 26 years old and live in Sacromento Ca. I have lived in Illinois for two year with my father.  While there I learned
                    all of my work ethic. After living there with my father I moved back Cali to 
                    live with my mother where I enrolled and finished my jr. high school and high 
                    school career at Foot Hill High School.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>After graduation I enrolled in American River Collage. My major at the time 
                    was Commercal Music and Recording. I really liked the first few levels of the major
                    but shortly found out that it was not for me. After figuring out that major was not me 
                    I got a job at Dairy Queen. While there I was taught how the work place is and customer
                    service. I spent four years there starting from the bottom working my way up to Shift lead.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>After working at Dairy Queen for four year it was time to move on.  After I left there I worked for 
                    Bed Bath and Beyond for a short time before I figured out that retail was on my cup of tea. So after figuring 
                    that out I got a job at Amazon.  I had applied on a whim not really expecting to really get the job. But after a few days
                    I got an email back telling me to got to new hire event. Then a few months later in October 2017 the building opened.
                    They hired something liek 4000 people all at the same time plus it was also the begaining of the haliday season.
